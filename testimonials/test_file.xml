He is knowledgeable about so many items, be it advanced excel skills, internet web page design, access, etc. He could manipulate price lists and post them to a website faster than anyone else I have seen. I look forward to one day working with Scott again. He is the kind of person you work with that you will be saying &#x93;I am glad it is Monday&#x94;.</description><pubDate>2010-01-10 12:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Jim and Marian Young</title><link>www.webelenses.com</link><region>Lebanon Tennessee</region><description>After endless problems with our former designers/hosting, we found Music City Guru. Best move we ever made. Fast, responsive, imaginative and resourceful, these guys saved our business. It's not "all about the money" with MCG, it's about the websites and customer needs.
